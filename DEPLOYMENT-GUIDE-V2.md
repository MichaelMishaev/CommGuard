export DEBUG="true"
```

### Feature Toggles (in code)
```javascript
// Edit commguard-v2.js if needed
FEATURES: {
    INVITE_LINK_DETECTION: true,        // ✅ Keep enabled
    AUTO_KICK_BLACKLISTED: true,        // ✅ Keep enabled  
    RESTRICT_COUNTRY_CODES: true,       // ⚙️ Adjust as needed
    FIREBASE_INTEGRATION: false,        // ⚙️ Set to true if Firebase available
    DEBUG_MODE: false                   // ⚙️ Set to true for troubleshooting
}
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Admin Error
```
❌ Bot needs admin permissions to [action]
```
**Solution:**
1. Make bot admin in WhatsApp group
2. Send #status to verify admin status shows "✅ ADMIN"

### QR Code Issues
```
❌ Connection failed / QR code not working
```
**Solution:**
1. Clear auth data: `rm -rf baileys_auth_info`
2. Restart bot: `node commguard-v2.js`
3. Scan fresh QR code

### Invite Links Not Detected
```
❌ Invite links not being deleted/kicked
```
**Solution:**
1. Check bot has admin permissions
2. Test with #test command - should show all PASS
3. Verify invite link pattern: https://chat.whatsapp.com/ABC123

### Commands Not Working
```
❌ Commands return "Unknown command"
```
**Solution:**
1. Use commands in correct context:
   - #help → Private chat only
   - #clear, #kick, #status → Group chat only
   - #blacklist → Either context
2. Only admins can use commands in groups

### Session Errors
```
❌ "No session found to decrypt message"
```
**Solution:**
1. These are normal and handled automatically
2. Bot will auto-clear auth if too many errors
3. For manual fix: `rm -rf baileys_auth_info` and restart
